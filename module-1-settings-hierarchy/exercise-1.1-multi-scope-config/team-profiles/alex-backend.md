# Developer Profile: Alex (Backend Lead)

## Role

Backend lead, 4 years experience. Responsible for API design and database architecture.

## Personal Preferences

- Prefers **Concise** output style -- doesn't want long explanations, just the code
- Uses `claude-opus-4-6` model for complex architectural decisions
- Always wants co-authored-by attribution in commits
- Prefers plan mode for safety on critical changes

## Working Style

- Runs multiple Claude sessions in parallel
- Wants verbose logging when debugging
- Prefers strict permission mode (`default`) for personal projects
- Uses dark terminal theme (no impact on settings, just context)

## Current Task

Working on the main branch, standard API development. No special overrides needed.
