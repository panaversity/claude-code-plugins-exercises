# Original Ralph Loop Command

```bash
/ralph-loop "Fix all the issues in the project and make it production-ready" \
--max-iterations 15 \
--completion-promise "everything works"
```

## Context

The developer wanted to clean up a Python project with type errors, test failures, and a missing configuration file. They wrote a broad task description and a vague completion promise.
